0. Type in 'make' and then './FinalProject' to compile and run.
1. Use (w/a/s/d) to move around the town and the arrows to change view angles. This allows you to see the fog and as you get closer to an object it becomes clearer and less foggy.
2. Press 'k' to arrive in the perspective view. Press 'h' (zoom in, 'g' to zoom out) and keep pressing it till you see the city. At first you will see barely anything due to the fog, as you zoom in you will see more clearly. (The effect of the fog)
3. Next use the arrow keys while still in the perspective view to have an overall view of the town. Disable the fog for a better view of the town by pressing 'f'.

6.  Press '8' for a FPS of the bell. Use w/a/s/d to move around the bell and the arrow keys for different view angles. The bell is made out of 3 parts, its dome, the exterior of the bell and the interior of the bell. Press 'f' to disable/enable fog for a better view. Press 'l' to light up the scene.
7.  Press '7' for a view of the playground (FPS) use w/a/s/d move around and arrow keys to change the view angle. The monkey bar is there as well as the cart. Press 'f' to disable/enable fog for a better view. Press 'l' to light up the scene if desired.
